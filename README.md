## Hi, I’m Cristiano de Paula

Senior Software Engineer and Software Architect with strong hands-on experience in full-stack development and backend architecture. I focus on designing scalable, maintainable, and business-oriented systems, covering the full lifecycle from system design and implementation to deployment, observability, and continuous improvement.

My background includes working in startups and building complex systems end-to-end, with practical experience in microservices, event-driven architectures, APIs, authentication and authorization, cloud infrastructure, and AI-enabled solutions.

I value clear architecture, well-defined trade-offs, and pragmatic engineering decisions over volume of code.
